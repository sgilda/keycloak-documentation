= Parameters Forwarding

The {project_name}  initial authorization endpoint request has support for various parameters. Most of the parameters are described in
http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#AuthorizationEndpoint[OIDC specification]. Some parameters are added automatically by the adapter based
on the adapter configuration. However, there are also a few parameters that can be added on a per-invocation basis. When you open the secured application URI,
the particular parameter will be forwarded to the {project_name} authorization endpoint.

For example, if you request an offline token, then you can open the secured application URI with the `scope` parameter like:

[source]
----
http://myappserver/mysecuredapp?scope=offline_access
----

and the parameter `scope=offline_access` will be automatically forwarded to the {project_name} authorization endpoint.

The supported parameters are:

* scope

* prompt

* max_age

* login_hint

* kc_idp_hint

Most of the parameters are described in the http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#AuthorizationEndpoint[OIDC specification].
The only exception is parameter `kc_idp_hint`, which is specific to {project_name} and contains the name of the identity provider to automatically use.
